# CO₂ Emissions Analysis in Africa

## Overview
This project explores CO₂ emissions data for African countries.  
It analyzes how emissions change **over time**, **by sector**, and **by region**, and checks whether the **sum of sectoral emissions** matches the **reported national totals**.

##  Goals
- Find which **countries and regions** emit the most CO₂.  
- See which **sectors** (like energy, transport, or agriculture) contribute most.  
- Compare **sector sums** to **reported totals** to check data accuracy.  
- Analyze **trends over the years**.

##  Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook `EDA.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter.  
2. Run all cells to see the visualizations and analysis.  
3. Enter your desired **country** and **year** when prompted.

## Key Insights
- Energy and Transport are the biggest emission sources.  
- Northern Africa shows higher total emissions.  
- Reported totals are often higher than the sum of sectors — the gap increases over time.
